Commands that are similar to grep in the terminal

This report is based on the lab 3 report as it was the most fun report I did before. Instead, I challenged myself to find 8 similar options instead of 4

The command line option  "grep 'find'"

The "grep" command searches for lines containing the specified search pattern, in this case 'find', in the specified file. The output displays each line in the file that contains the search pattern. In this example, we searched for the pattern 'find' in the file 'find-results.txt', and it returned all the lines in the file containing the pattern.

The command "locate"

The 'locate' command is used to quickly find files on a Linux system by searching a pre-built database of file names and paths. It is faster than 'find' as it doesn't search the filesystem in real-time, but instead relies on a periodically updated index.

The command "find"

The find command is a powerful tool used in Unix-based operating systems to locate files and directories based on a wide range of search criteria such as name, size, modification time, and permissions. It recursively searches through a directory hierarchy and returns a list of all files and directories that match the specified criteria.

The "pt" command, short for "The Platinum Searcher," is a fast, code-searching tool for programmers that searches through files using regular expressions. It is designed to be a faster and more efficient alternative to the popular "grep" command.

The command "sed"

Sed, short for stream editor, is a powerful command-line utility used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or standard input). It allows for searching and replacing text, deleting lines, and modifying text in place, among other operations, using regular expressions and commands.
